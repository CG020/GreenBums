# csc436-project

Camila - Hey guys, I started a Capacitor project and installed all the basic dependencies

I added the Android and IOS packages Capacitor has as default so we can do the cross platform part - the 
capacitor project itself is the greenbums folder 

I've pushed the packages and jsons 

When you pull, make sure you have installed Capacitor - I just used the Ionic extension on VSCODE,
and then just run:

npm install
npx cap sync

This should set up the project and all the dependencies on your device



Camila - I added some styling and stuff for the home page and some notes

in terminal run:
npm start
and follow the link local host thing to see a preview of what the site/app will look like
